## What I've learned
I built it for the sake of understanding how to build a full stack app with MERN Stack, wrote the custom jwt auth, stored in cookies for better security, I understood how frontend and backend interact properly, and how hard it is to build from scratch without using meta framework like next/remix. 

## Challenges
- embedding tweets, articles and youtube videos in a card
- storing the jwt in cookie, making routes protected.
- retriving content id in frontend to delete

## Improvments
It can be improved in a lot of ways, 
- ai can be integrated on personal data, and user can ask questions. 
- making it responsive(design wasn't a focus so I left it)
- tag based searching, filtering
